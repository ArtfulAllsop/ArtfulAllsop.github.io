### Website Information:

This has been created for the testing and design of my own personal website. The website is being hosted by GitHub Pages and uses a free domain name and was developed with VSC ode, Docker and Jekyll using a Windows 11 environment. The website is for personal use and only used as a learning tool for my own interests. It's not to be taken seriously.
